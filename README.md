# spark-play
Getting to know Apache Spark with pyspark
---------------------------------------------

This code is intended to document my learning of Spark and pyspark, so I can return to this repository to remind myself who to use it.

I'll start with working on my local machine, doing basic data manipulation and transformation stuff.
Then I'll use some of Spark machine learning algorithms.

A key focus will be using functional programming style to write parallelizable code.

If I get far enough, I'll look to set up and small cloud host to connect to, and maybe build a recommendation app or something...
